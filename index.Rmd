I am a current second year student in the Biostatistics MS program at the University of Minnesota, from which I plan to graduate on May 2022. Previously I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Statistics from the University of Costa Rica in 2020. 

My main interests in statistics lie in the areas of machine learning/prediction, causal inference, with a bit of survival analysis. I also like to find innovative ways of creating engaging visualizations for communicating results based on data and analyses.
